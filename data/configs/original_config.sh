# After mapping, the choice of what kinds of reads should be kept is specified

# https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html

# The flags used below mean unmapped reads are excluded (-F 4) and only properly
# aligned pairs are kept (-f 3).

# See http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html for a description of samtools

# calculation (described at https://dx.doi.org/10.1093%2Fbioinformatics%2Fbtr076)
# is turned off, as seems to be appropriate for HIV
# (https://tinyurl.com/noBAQnoCry); the minimum quality for a base to be
# retained is 5 (for backward/historical consistency), and only the first
# 1000000 reads mapped to each point will be considered (NB a limit must be
# provided; the default is 250).
# Important note for data with overlapping read pairs: samtools mpileup avoids
# double counting sequence in the overlap of a read pair by setting the quality
# of all bases in the overlap to zero, for one of the two reads in the pair; 
# then with any value of --min-BQ strictly greater than zero, these bases are
# effectively deleted, such that the overlap sequence is counted only once.
# If you set --min-BQ equal to zero, these bases will be counted (which is
# generally undesirable).

# The minimum fraction of reads at a position before we call that base (or those
# bases, when one base alone does not reach that threshold fraction; e.g. say
# you have 60% A, 30% C and 10% G: if you set this fraction to 0.6 or lower we
# call an A, if you set it to 0.6-0.9 we call an M for "A or C", if you set it
# to 0.9-1 we call a V for "A, C or G".). Alternatively, if you choose a
# negative value, we always call the single most common base regardless of its
# fraction, unless two or more bases are equally (most) common, then we call the
# ambiguity code for those bases.

# Shall we remove read pairs marked as duplicates? i.e. using picard, for each
# set of pairs sharing the same mapped coordinates (start & end of each mate),

# Shall we remap to the consensus? (For remapping, gaps in coverage in the

# Shall we generate a version of the base frequencies file that also includes
# HXB2 coordinates (by aligning the reference used for mapping to HXB2)? Useful
